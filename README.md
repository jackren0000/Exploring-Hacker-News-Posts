### **Hacker News: When's the Best Time to Post? ‚è∞**

Hacker News is a huge deal in the tech world. A top post can mean a flood of traffic and attention. So, we dug into a dataset of 20,000 posts to answer a simple question: when is the best time to post to get the most comments?

#### **Our Game Plan üó∫Ô∏è**

1.  **Ask HN vs. Show HN:** We started by filtering the posts into two main categories: "Ask HN" (where users ask questions) and "Show HN" (where users show off their projects).

2.  **Comment Battle üí¨:** We compared the average number of comments for "Ask HN" and "Show HN" posts. It turns out that **"Ask HN" posts get more comments on average**. People are more likely to engage when you ask them a question directly.

3.  **Timing is Everything ‚è≥:** We then focused on "Ask HN" posts and analyzed them by the hour they were posted. We wanted to see if there's a "golden hour" for posting.

#### **The Big Reveal ‚ú®**

The best time to post on Hacker News is around **3:00 PM EST (5:00 AM in Melbourne)**. Posts made during this time get significantly more comments than at any other time of day. The next best times are 2:00 AM, 8:00 PM, 4:00 PM, and 9:00 PM EST.
